## Weather Data Analysis & Automation (weather_data_analysis.py)
This project focuses on automating the extraction and numerical analysis of historical weather data. The script reads from a CSV file, performs data cleaning, and calculates key metrics like mean temperature, humidity, and precipitation for user-specified months and years.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Python scripting for data automation.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Numerical analysis and statistical calculations.
- User input handling.

**Files:**
- weather_data_analysis.py: The core Python script for the analysis.
- WeatherDataCLL.csv: The dataset containing 10 years of weather data.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values.

**Files:**

- hotel_booking_EDA_miniproject.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis.
- hotel_bookings.csv: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
